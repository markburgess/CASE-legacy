The use of defaults in constructor declarations confuses the compiler in some
cases and causes it to FAIL to recoignize the correct constructor. This
can lead to segmentation faults if one just write

  grid = new CATriangularGrid;

(without the implicit arguments);

Things like CornerCellsXY etc. They have no place in a triangular
geometry.
