Tue May 21 13:13:26 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <sevaldt@borg (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* X2Dview.h: Dropped the "zoom_out" routine on the right mouse
	button. Instead I made a callback routine called "widget_rt_click"
	similar to the widget_click" routine.
 
Tue May  7 11:39:42 1996  Cellular Automaton Projec  <cell@borg (Cellular Automaton Projec)>

	* X2Dview.c (widget_dblclick): New callback resource. Changed name
	on XtNselect callback resource to XtNclick. Both routines sends
	logical coordinates of mouse pointer as call_data.

Thu May  2 00:25:50 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* X2Dview.c (X2DdrawRectangle): Two new drawing procedures,
	X2DdrawRectangle and X2DfilledRectangle
	(X2DinitPalette): New resource, XtNinstall. This is a boolean flag
	which determines if we should install a private colormap. If True,
	a new colormap will be made, with all cells allocated read/write.
	The colors of the default colormap is copied into the new colormap
	initially, but this can of course be changed, possibly making the
	rest of your windows look like shit :-) The point of this is of
	course to get a maximum number of colors ( <= 256).

	(X2DinitPalette): Major rework of color routines (again).Widget
	now uses an array of pixel values. This array is filled with
	indices to free color cells through XAllocColorCells. Colors are
	set in this array with the function
	setrgbpalette. This function sets the RGB values of the color
	pointed to by the value in index n in the palette array (puh :-).
	X2DsetForeground now takes an index to the palette
	array, instead of the colormap itself. The beauty of this approach
	is that now I can reference the colors in my own palette from
	index 0 and up to max available colors and be sure that when I
	allocate a color at index n in the palette array, it will be in
	position n, and not some random place as in an X Colormap.

Tue Apr 30 13:08:45 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <sevaldt@borg>

	* X2Dview.c (X2DfilledEllipse): 4 new drawing functions,
	X2DdrawEllipse, X2DfilledEllipse, X2DdrawArc, X2DfilledArc.

Wed Apr 24 14:12:43 1996  Cellular Automaton Projec  <cell@borg (Cellular Automaton Projec)>

	* X2Dview.c (select_widget): This routine now sends the mouse
	pointer coordinates as callback data.

Tue Apr 23 10:49:34 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* X2Dview.c (X2DsetFont): New function for setting font for text
	drawing functions. 

Sun Apr 21 07:26:16 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* X2Dview.c: fixed up the MULTIBUF routines.

Thu Apr  4 14:00:21 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* X2Dview.doc: At last started writing some docs :-)

	* X2Dview.c (X2DcurrentPageFront): New double-buffering
	routines. Programming interface now consistes of two routines for
	double buffering: X2DcurrentPageBack and CurrentPageFront. See doc
	for details. New R6.1 double buffering extension
	implemented. Compile with MB_DBE for Xdbe extension. Compile with
	MB_MULTIBUF for old Xmbuf extension. X2Dview can not be compiled
	with both these flags defined. 

Wed Mar 20 11:23:29 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* X2DviewP.h Removed all references to dummy resource 'flag'

Wed Mar 20 11:12:29 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <sevaldt@borg (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* X2Dview.h: Changed all drawing routines to check a flag
	'draw_pixmap' to decide whether or not to draw in the pixmap as
	well as the window. This eliminates the 'X2DPixmap' and
	'X2Dsimple' versions of all the drawing routines. 

Wed Feb 28 09:36:01 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* trans2d.c: Cleaned up the rotation matrices by eliminating some 
	cos and sin-calculations. 

Mon Feb 26 12:45:13 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* trans2d.h: replaced all references to type 'point_coordinates', 
	with dynamically allocated double-arrays.

	* X2Dview.c (X2DdisplayCurrentBuffer): New routine for displaying
	the current buffer in a double-buffered display. 
	(X2DSwitchBuffer): Changed name from 'SwitchBuf'.

Sun Feb 25 09:02:45 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* X2Dview.c (X2DdrawPolygon): Began transforming all
	'point_coordinates' types to double *, since 'point_coordinates'
	is a fixed length array.

	Does not function properly, must think of something else...

Thu Feb 22 14:29:56 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* X2Dview.h: Removed all references to the 'palette' pixel array
	used in earlier versions.
	Changed name of X2DchangeGC to X2DchangeDrawingGC.

	* X2Dview.c (start_zoom): Set timeout value to 100ms. The previous
	value of 10 (!) caused problems on pentium based systems.

	* X2Dview.h: Total rewrite of drawing function interface. All
	colors are moved out of drawing functions and into
	X2DSetForeground and Background. Pixel and RGB versions of these
	two functions will be made. The "Widget" parameter is moved to the
	front of all drawing function parameter lists.

	This makes the widget incompatible with all previous versions.

Wed Jan 31 21:55:45 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* widget_tools.c (GetToplevelWidget): New file for general widget
	operations, like for instance this new function which returns the
	toplevel widget associated with a given widget.

	* X2Dview.c (X2DloadColormap): Implemented custom colormaps, tied
	to the toplevel widget. The toplevel widget is accessed via the
	toolkit routine GetToplevelWidget. 

Sun Jan 28 14:23:34 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* X2Dview.c (X2DloadColormap): New routine for loading of
	colormaps from a file.

Sat Jan 27 07:56:57 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* X2Dview.c (X2DbufferPoint): Converted back to index based color
	parameter. It was far to sluggish with the RGB based one.

Fri Jan 26 14:21:52 1996  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  <thomas@gandalf.sn.no (Thomas Engh Sevaldrud)>

	* X2Dview.c (X2DsetColorRGB): Some more verbosity in this routine
	(X2DbufferPoint): Converted from index-based color parameter to
	RGB based.

Tue Sep 26 09:53:30 1995  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  (Thomas@gandalf)

	* X2Dview.c (X2DchangeGC): New convenience routine for changing
	the GC values of the default drawing GC.

Mon Aug 28 01:58:31 1995  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  (Thomas@gandalf)

	* X2Dview.c (X2DflushBuffer): Made the point buffer routines
	by-pass the custom palette routines. Takes color index straight
	from color map. Planning on a major change in the color routines.

Sun Aug 27 02:43:14 1995  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  (Thomas@gandalf)

	* X2Dview.c (X2DclearAll): Did some minor changes to this routine,
	because of a bug that turned out to not be in this routine at
	all... but the changes shouldn't make any real difference.
	(X2DsetOuterLimits): New convenience routine for setting the outer
	limits of the coordinate system. (For zooming out).
	Some more cleaning up in the code.

Tue Aug 22 10:24:03 1995  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  (Thomas@gandalf)

	* X2Dview.c (X2DsetViewport): This routine now sets the default
	(outer) coordinate boundaries for the widget as well as the actual
	coordinate boundaries. This fixes zoom-out bug. 
	(X2DdrawCircle): Fixed problem with transforming radius value.

Mon Aug 21 01:31:47 1995  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  (Thomas@gandalf)

	* X2Dview.c (X2DdrawCircle): 6 new functions for drawing of
	circles, both outlined and filled. Small problem with transforming
	radius value from logical to actual value.

	* X2Dview.h: Some cleanup in code. Made prototypes C++ friendly.

Fri Aug 18 02:50:33 1995  Thomas Engh Sevaldrud  (Thomas@gandalf)

	* X2Dview.c (X2DclearAll): Fixed this routine so that it clears
	the whole pixmap/window, not only the parts of it that is
	exposed. This also fixes the bug making the pixmap look mashed
	when its created for the first time.

	* X2Dview.c: Tried to make the code more readable ;-)
